To **search for the `.key` file** in your Ubuntu server, use the following commands — but be warned, this can take some time depending on your file system size.

## 🔍 Step-by-Step: Find `.key` Files on Your Server

### 1. **Search for all `.key` files**

```bash
sudo find / -type f -name "*.key" 2>/dev/null
```

* This will **recursively search** the entire filesystem.
* `2>/dev/null` suppresses permission denied errors.

---

### 2. **Narrow to likely SSL/private key folders**

You can try these faster scoped searches:

```bash
sudo find /etc/ssl -type f -name "*.key"
sudo find /opt -type f -name "*.key"
sudo find /home -type f -name "*.key"
```

---

### 3. **Check known SSL paths manually**

```bash
ls -l /etc/ssl/private/
ls -l /etc/nginx/ssl/
ls -l /etc/letsencrypt/live/
```

---

## 🧠 Bonus: Check For Your Specific Key

If you know it might be named `religare.in.key`:

```bash
sudo find / -type f -name "religare.in.key" 2>/dev/null
```

---

## ⚠️ If You Still Don’t Find It

* It **was never uploaded** to this server.
* It’s likely sitting with whoever generated the certificate (on their local dev, laptop, or signing server).
* Without it, **your NGINX TLS config will break** — you *must* get this file.

---

Once you find or retrieve `religare.in.key`, copy it to:

```bash
sudo cp path/to/religare.in.key /etc/ssl/religare/religare.in.key
sudo chmod 600 /etc/ssl/religare/religare.in.key
```

Let me know once it’s in place — we’ll move on to the secure NGINX HTTPS config.
