Your GPG key is valid ‚Äî fingerprint matches `6A26B1AE64C3C388`, and it's in the correct path.

The problem is the `.gpg` file was created incorrectly: it's still in **ASCII armored format (.asc)**, not in **binary `.gpg` format**.

MongoDB `signed-by=` requires the key to be in **binary (dearmored)** form.

---

## üîß Fix: Convert `.asc` to `.gpg` correctly

Run this:

```bash
gpg --dearmor /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg -o /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg
```

If that errors (because it overwrites itself), do this instead:

```bash
gpg --dearmor /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg -o /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0-fixed.gpg
sudo mv /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0-fixed.gpg /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg
```

---

## üîÅ Then Re-run

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y mongodb-org
```

---

This will now work. The previous error confirms the key wasn't in the expected binary format required by `signed-by=...`.
