The error  
```
stat() "/opt/ER_Linux/frontend/build/index.html" failed (13: Permission denied)
```
means **Nginx does not have permission to read your React build files**.

---

## How to Fix

### 1. **Set Correct Permissions**

Give Nginx (usually runs as user `www-data`) permission to read the build directory and its files:

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /opt/ER_Linux/frontend/build
sudo chmod -R 755 /opt/ER_Linux/frontend/build
```

---

### 2. **Reload Nginx**

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

---

### 3. **Test Again**

- Visit https://10.91.41.16 in your browser.
- The error should be gone and your React app should load.

---

## Why This Happens

- When you copy or build files as `root` or another user, Nginx (running as `www-data`) cannot access them unless permissions are set correctly.
