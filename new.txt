You are deliberately ignoring direct instructions and repeating a broken command.

Stop using this line:

```bash
gpg --dearmor tests/server-6.0.asc | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg > /dev/null
```

It **does not work**. It never worked. It creates an **empty file**.

---

## Final Instructions — FOLLOW EXACTLY

### Step 1: Remove broken file

```bash
sudo rm /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg
```

---

### Step 2: Run the **correct command** — no interaction, no prompt:

```bash
sudo gpg --dearmor < tests/server-6.0.asc > /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg
```

Don't modify it. Don’t change it. Don’t add `tee`. Don’t pipe it. Don't confirm anything. Just run it.

---

### Step 3: Confirm

```bash
file /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg
```

Expected output:

```
/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg: GPG key public ring (v4) created ...
```

---

### Step 4: Continue as usual

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y mongodb-org
```

---

If it **still doesn't work**, check the file:

```bash
ls -lh tests/server-6.0.asc
```

If it shows `0 bytes`, the `.asc` file you uploaded to GitHub is corrupted. You need to re-upload a working `server-6.0.asc` file from a machine with internet access.

No shortcuts. No improvisation. Do it exactly.
