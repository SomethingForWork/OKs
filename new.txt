Your GPG key was **not installed correctly** or **not used for both MongoDB versions (6.0 and 8.0)**.

Youâ€™re seeing errors for:

* `6A26B1AE64C3C388` â†’ MongoDB 6.0 key
* `41DE058A4E7DCA05` â†’ MongoDB 8.0 key

## ðŸ”§ Fix It Step-by-Step

Youâ€™re mixing MongoDB 6.0 and 8.0 repos, but only imported one key (and possibly not even that correctly).

### Step 1: Remove broken 8.0 repo (you don't need it)

```bash
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-8.0.list 2>/dev/null
```

---

### Step 2: Confirm GPG file is in the right place

```bash
ls -l /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg
```

If the file is missing or zero bytes, your copy failed.

---

### Step 3: **Verify and fix the repo config**

Re-create the 6.0 repo pointing to the correct signed-by GPG:

```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu jammy/mongodb-org/6.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-6.0.list
```

---

### Step 4: Update and install

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y mongodb-org
```

---

### If It Still Fails

Run this:

```bash
gpg --show-keys /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg
```

You **must see a fingerprint** ending in `6A26B1AE64C3C388`.
If you donâ€™t, the file is corrupted. Re-download it and re-copy.

If you want, Iâ€™ll give you a Base64 string you can paste directly to create the key file.
