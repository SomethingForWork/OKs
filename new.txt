Your directory permissions and ownership look **correct** for Nginx to read your React build files:

```
drwxr-xr-x 5 root     root     4096 Jul 18 11:05 /opt
drwxr-xr-x 5 www-data www-data 4096 Jul 18 11:06 /opt/ER_Linux
drwxr-xr-x 6 www-data www-data 4096 Jul 18 12:22 /opt/ER_Linux/frontend
drwxr-xr-x 3 www-data www-data 4096 Jul 18 12:23 /opt/ER_Linux/frontend/build
```

**If you are still seeing "Permission denied" errors:**

---

## 1. **Check File Permissions Inside the Build Directory**

Run:
```bash
ls -l /opt/ER_Linux/frontend/build
```
and
```bash
ls -l /opt/ER_Linux/frontend/build/index.html
```
- Make sure all files (especially `index.html`) are owned by `www-data` and have at least `-rw-r--r--` permissions.

---

## 2. **Check SELinux/AppArmor (if enabled)**

If you are on a hardened system, SELinux or AppArmor may block access even if Unix permissions are correct.

- To check if SELinux is enforcing:
  ```bash
  getenforce
  ```
  If it says `Enforcing`, try:
  ```bash
  setenforce 0
  ```
  (for testing only; if this fixes it, you need to adjust SELinux policies.)

---

## 3. **Restart Nginx**

Sometimes, after changing permissions, a full restart helps:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

---

## 4. **Check for Symlinks**

If any directory in the path is a symlink, make sure Nginx is allowed to follow symlinks (default is yes, but check).

---

## 5. **Final Test**

- After all the above, try accessing your site again.
- If you still get permission denied, paste the output of:
  ```bash
  ls -l /opt/ER_Linux/frontend/build/index.html
  ```

**You are very close! If you follow these steps, the permission issue will be resolved. Let me know the output if youâ€™re still stuck!**
