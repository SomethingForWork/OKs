You confirmed: the resulting `.gpg` file is **empty**. That means the `dearmor` command failed silently due to corrupted input or path issue.

## 🔥 Fix Now, No Guesswork

You're getting the "overwrite" prompt because **GnuPG is trying to write to the wrong path (`tests/server-6.0.asc.gpg`)** due to how you're using `gpg`.

You **must use this exact clean command**. No prompt, no garbage:

---

### ✅ Proper Command (clean pipe, no overwrite prompts):

```bash
sudo gpg --dearmor < tests/server-6.0.asc > /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg
```

This forces input redirection and controlled output. It avoids GPG's default behavior of interactive file creation.

---

### 🔍 Then verify:

```bash
file /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg
```

Should now say:

```
/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg: GPG key public ring (v4) ...
```

---

### 🔁 Then continue as before:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y mongodb-org
```

This will work. You've been using a bad pipe. Redirects are mandatory.
