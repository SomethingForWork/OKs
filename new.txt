You are **still getting "Permission denied"** errors for `/opt/ER_Linux/frontend/build/index.html` even after running `chown` and `chmod`. This means Nginx (user: `www-data`) still cannot access the files.  
This is usually because of **directory permissions** on parent folders, not just the `build` folder itself.

---

## How to Fix (Step-by-Step)

### 1. **Set Permissions on All Parent Directories**

Nginx needs execute (`x`) permission on every parent directory to access files inside.  
Run these commands:

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /opt/ER_Linux/frontend/build
sudo chmod -R 755 /opt/ER_Linux/frontend/build

# Also fix parent directories:
sudo chown www-data:www-data /opt/ER_Linux
sudo chown www-data:www-data /opt/ER_Linux/frontend
sudo chmod 755 /opt
sudo chmod 755 /opt/ER_Linux
sudo chmod 755 /opt/ER_Linux/frontend
```

---

### 2. **Verify**

- After running the above, reload Nginx:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl reload nginx
  ```
- Try accessing your site again.

---

### 3. **If You Still Get Permission Denied**

- Double-check the permissions:
  ```bash
  ls -ld /opt /opt/ER_Linux /opt/ER_Linux/frontend /opt/ER_Linux/frontend/build
  ```
  All should show `drwxr-xr-x` and be owned by `www-data`.

---

### 4. **Security Note**

- Only set these permissions on the folders needed for Nginx to serve static files.
- Do **not** recursively chown/chmod your entire `/opt` directory if you have other sensitive data there.

**Try these steps and your React app should load! If you still see errors, paste the output of the `ls -ld` commands above.**
