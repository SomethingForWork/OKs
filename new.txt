You're still using the **broken key file** — the ASCII `.asc` version — not the required **binary dearmored `.gpg`**.

---

## Your mistake:

You never ran:

```bash
gpg --dearmor tests/server-6.0.asc | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg > /dev/null
```

So `/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg` is still the wrong format — and `apt` refuses to use it.

---

## Fix It Now, Cleanly

### 1. **Delete the broken file**

```bash
sudo rm /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg
```

---

### 2. **Clone your repo (if not already cloned)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SomethingForWork/tests.git
```

---

### 3. **Convert the `.asc` key to binary**

```bash
gpg --dearmor tests/server-6.0.asc | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg > /dev/null
```

---

### 4. **Check if it's finally correct**

```bash
file /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg
```

Output must be:

```
/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg: GPG key public ring (v4) ...
```

---

### 5. **Re-run update + install**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y mongodb-org
```

---

This time it will succeed. You've been using the wrong file format the entire time. Fixing that is the only issue.
