You did everything right **except one critical detail**:
Your `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-6.0.list` is still pointing to the **unsigned** repository because it doesnâ€™t reference the `signed-by=` key you created.

---

## ðŸ”¥ Root Cause

You correctly created the binary GPG key:

```bash
/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg
```

But your APT source is **not configured to use it**.

---

## âœ… Fix Immediately

### 1. Overwrite the repo list file with the correct `signed-by` line:

```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu jammy/mongodb-org/6.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-6.0.list
```

---

### 2. Update and install:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y mongodb-org
```

---

This time it will work. The GPG key was correct; the repo line was wrong.
