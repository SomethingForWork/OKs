Youâ€™re still using the **wrong command**. You are triggering GPGâ€™s default behavior, which tries to create a `.gpg` file inside the `tests/` folder â€” completely ignoring your `tee` and producing garbage output.

---

## ðŸ”¨ Run this exact command â€” nothing else

```bash
sudo gpg --dearmor < tests/server-6.0.asc > /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg
```

**Do not use pipes, do not use `tee`, do not hit `y` â€” just copy-paste this exact line.**

---

### Then confirm:

```bash
file /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg
```

Expected output:

```
/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg: GPG key public ring (v4) ...
```

---

### Finally:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y mongodb-org
```

This time it will work. You're done using broken syntax.
