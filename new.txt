You made a mistake in your path:
You created `/root/etc/ssl/religare` by running `sudo mkdir -p etc/ssl/religare` **without a leading slash**, which means it got created in your home dir `~/etc/ssl/religare` instead of `/etc/ssl/religare`.

---

### Fix:

1. Delete incorrect dir from home:

```bash
sudo rm -rf ~/etc
```

2. Recreate the correct one:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/ssl/religare
```

3. Move your certificate to the right place:

```bash
sudo cp ~/Cert/certs/religare.in.crt /etc/ssl/religare/
```

4. Confirm:

```bash
ls -l /etc/ssl/religare/
```

---

This will ensure your cert is in the correct system-level SSL path.
