Thank you for the details.  
Your output:
```
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
...
<pre>Cannot GET /</pre>
```
means your Express backend **is not serving `index.html` for the root route `/`**.

---

## **Why is this happening?**

- Your catch-all route for serving `index.html` is either:
  - **Not present** at the very end of your Express app, or
  - **Not being reached** because of an earlier route or error handler, or
  - **Not matching the root route `/`** (e.g., you have a more specific route before it).

---

## **How to Fix (Step by Step)**

### 1. **Ensure the Catch-All Route is the LAST Route**

At the **very end** of your `server/index.js`, after ALL other routes and error handlers, add:

```js
const path = require('path');
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../frontend/build/index.html'));
});
```
**Do NOT use `app.use` for this. Use `app.get('*', ...)`!**

---

### 2. **Restart Your Backend**

```bash
pm2 restart er_backend
```

---

### 3. **Test Again**

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:3000
```
- You should now see the full HTML of your React app (not "Cannot GET /").

---

## **Why use `app.get('*', ...)` instead of `app.use`?**

- `app.use` will match all HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.), which can break your API endpoints.
- `app.get('*', ...)` only matches GET requests not handled by previous routes, which is what you want for serving the React app.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Route Type         | Express Route Needed                |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| API endpoints      | `app.get('/api/...')`, etc.         |
| React frontend     | `app.get('*', ...)` at the very end |

---

**After this change, your React app will load for any unknown GET route, and your API endpoints will still work.**

If you still see issues, paste the last 10 lines of your `server/index.js` and Iâ€™ll check it for you!
