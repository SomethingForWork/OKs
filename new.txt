You're still blocked because:

1. The MongoDB **GPG key isn't accepted**, even though your `.gpg` file is correct.
2. You're still getting `NO_PUBKEY` → apt is **not using the key file**.
3. You didn't fix the **cache lock**, so installation didn't run.

## 🔥 Fix It — Final Clean Execution

### 🔁 1. Clean broken setup and existing MongoDB lists

```bash
sudo rm -f /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg
sudo rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*mongodb*.list
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
sudo apt clean
```

---

### ✅ 2. Add new GPG key correctly

You already cloned the repo. Now run:

```bash
sudo gpg --dearmor < tests/server-6.0.asc | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg > /dev/null
```

Confirm:

```bash
file /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg
```

Should say `GPG key public ring`.

---

### ✅ 3. Create correct apt source list

```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu jammy/mongodb-org/6.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-6.0.list
```

---

### ✅ 4. Force apt to use the key

Clear the apt cache again and re-index:

```bash
sudo apt clean
sudo apt update --allow-insecure-repositories
```

⚠️ If same error: bypass apt-key by directly importing to the system keyring (fallback):

```bash
sudo cp /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg
```

Then run:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

---

### ⚙️ 5. Ensure no other apt process is blocking

Run:

```bash
ps aux | grep apt
```

If `apt` process still running, **kill it**:

```bash
sudo kill -9 PID
```

Replace `PID` with the actual process ID you see.

---

### 🚀 6. Install

```bash
sudo apt install -y mongodb-org
```

---

### 🔁 If It Still Fails

Download `.deb` manually from a system with internet:
[https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

Use “Linux x86\_64 Ubuntu 22.04” → Copy the `.deb` files to server via GitHub or SCP and install:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i *.deb
```

---

This is the end of online install troubleshooting. If this doesn’t work, use **offline .deb install** only.
