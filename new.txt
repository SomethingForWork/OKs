You are **very close**!  
The error is now clear:

```
stat() "/opt/ER_Linux/frontend/build/index.html" failed (13: Permission denied)
```

This means **Nginx still cannot read the files** in your build directory, even after you ran `chown` and `chmod`.

---

## Why?  
This is almost always because **one of the parent directories** (`/opt`, `/opt/ER_Linux`, `/opt/ER_Linux/frontend`) does **not** have the correct "execute" (`x`) permission for the `www-data` user.

---

## **How to Fix:**

### 1. **Fix Parent Directory Permissions**

Run these commands to ensure Nginx can traverse the path:

```bash
sudo chmod o+x /opt
sudo chmod o+x /opt/ER_Linux
sudo chmod o+x /opt/ER_Linux/frontend
```

- The `o+x` means "others can enter/traverse this directory" (needed for static file serving).

---

### 2. **Verify**

After running the above, try again:

```bash
curl -vk https://10.91.41.16/
```

---

### 3. **If Still Fails**

- Double-check with:
  ```bash
  namei -l /opt/ER_Linux/frontend/build/index.html
  ```
  - This will show permissions for every directory in the path. All must have `x` for "others" or for the `www-data` group.

---

### 4. **Recap**

- **Files**: need to be readable (`r`) by `www-data`
- **Directories**: need to be traversable (`x`) by `www-data`

---

## **Once you do this, your app should load!**

Let me know the result after fixing the parent directory permissions and reloading the page. If it still fails, paste the output of `namei -l /opt/ER_Linux/frontend/build/index.html`.
