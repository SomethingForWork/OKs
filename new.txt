You're still hitting the same GPG error because:

* The **repo file path is incorrect**
* You likely have **duplicate or broken entries**
* You **havenâ€™t removed the old bad `.list` file**
* The keyfile is now correct, but APT isn't referencing it properly

---

## ðŸ§¨ Current Problem Summary

APT still doesnâ€™t associate the repository with your GPG key due to:

1. You added the repo to `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/.mongodb-org-6.0.list` â†’ bad filename (starts with a dot).
2. Likely duplicate/broken MongoDB repo entries.
3. GPG key is valid, but never actually used by APT.

## âœ… Fix It Properly â€” Copy-Paste Exactly

### 1. Remove all old MongoDB list files

```bash
sudo rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*mongodb*.list
```

---

### 2. Add the correct MongoDB 6.0 repo pointing to the correct key

```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu jammy/mongodb-org/6.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-6.0.list
```

---

### 3. Run update + install

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y mongodb-org
```

---

### 4. Verify success

You should **not** see:

```
NO_PUBKEY 6A26B1AE64C3C388
```

And install should proceed.

No more edits. Donâ€™t add `.mongodb...list`, donâ€™t reuse old lists, and donâ€™t rename the key.
