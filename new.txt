Excellent, you’ve made progress!  
Now, **Nginx is serving HTTPS and the SSL handshake is working**.  
But you’re getting a **500 Internal Server Error** from Nginx when accessing `/`.

---

## What does this mean?

A 500 error from Nginx (when accessing `/`) almost always means:
- Nginx tried to serve a file or proxy a request, but something failed **on the server side**.
- Since `/` should serve your React build’s `index.html`, the most likely causes are:
  1. The build directory is missing or permissions are wrong.
  2. The `root` or `index` directive in your Nginx config is incorrect.
  3. There’s a typo or misconfiguration in your Nginx config.
  4. SELinux/AppArmor is blocking access (less common).

---

## **Step-by-step Fix**

### 1. **Check React Build Directory**

```bash
ls -l /opt/ER_Linux/frontend/build
```
- You should see `index.html` and static files.
- If not, you need to rebuild your frontend.

---

### 2. **Check Nginx Config**

**Your config should have:**
```nginx
root /opt/ER_Linux/frontend/build;
index index.html;
location / {
  try_files $uri /index.html;
}
```
- Make sure there are **no typos** in the path.
- Make sure the `root` path is correct and matches the actual build directory.

---

### 3. **Check Permissions**

```bash
ls -ld /opt/ER_Linux/frontend/build
ls -l /opt/ER_Linux/frontend/build
```
- The `build` directory and its files should be **readable by the nginx user** (usually `www-data`).
- If not, fix with:
  ```bash
  sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /opt/ER_Linux/frontend/build
  sudo chmod -R 755 /opt/ER_Linux/frontend/build
  ```

---

### 4. **Check Nginx Error Log**

```bash
sudo tail -n 50 /var/log/nginx/error.log
```
- This will show the **exact reason** for the 500 error (e.g., file not found, permission denied, etc.).

---

### 5. **Reload Nginx**

After any changes:
```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

---

## **What to do next:**

1. **Run the above checks.**
2. **Paste the output of:**
   - `ls -l /opt/ER_Linux/frontend/build`
   - `sudo tail -n 50 /var/log/nginx/error.log`
3. **If you spot a permissions or missing file error, fix it and reload Nginx.**

---

**Once you provide the above outputs, I’ll help you resolve the 500 error!**
