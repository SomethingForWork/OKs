Hi Divyansh ,

PFB list of observations we discussed :

1 - Addition of a column as Application name in Employees/Reviewer Tab
3 - while manual review creation , email to reviewer should trigger
4 - While uploading file for review , canâ€™t identify the failed rows.
8 - Feature Syncing - if employee gets uploaded manually no option to assign role , but if getting the same uploaded through excel i can assign roles
9 - Preview of uploaded data available for review upload , but the same is not available for employee upload
11 - why do employees allowed for disable enabled functionality
12 - In Excel there's no validation for @ or email , but while manual addition or modification there;s a validation.
14 - Excel columns mapping validation to be validated while uploading with errors to be displayed

Thanks & Regards,
Shivam
