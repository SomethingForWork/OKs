If the `curl` command is not responding, here are some troubleshooting steps and alternatives, **all using your whitelisted sources**:

---

## 1. **Check Network/Firewall**

- Make sure your server can reach `https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-6.0.asc`.
- Try:
  ```bash
  curl -v https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-6.0.asc
  ```
  - If this hangs or fails, your server may not have outbound access to that URL, or there is a proxy/firewall issue.

---

## 2. **Try wget Instead of curl**

```bash
wget https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-6.0.asc -O /tmp/server-6.0.asc
sudo cp /tmp/server-6.0.asc /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg
```
- This uses `wget` (also whitelisted) and avoids curl.

---

## 3. **Direct Download and Move**

If you have access to another machine with internet, download the key there and then SCP it to your server:
```bash
# On your local machine:
wget https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-6.0.asc

# Then copy to your server:
scp server-6.0.asc user@your-server:/tmp/
# On the server:
sudo cp /tmp/server-6.0.asc /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg
```

## 4. **Check for Proxy Issues**

If your organization uses a proxy, you may need to set `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` environment variables for `curl` or `wget` to work.

---

## 5. **Verify File After Download**

After using any method, check the file:
```bash
ls -l /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg
head /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg
```
- It should start with `-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----`

---

## 6. **Continue with Repository Setup**

Once the key is in place, continue with:
```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu jammy/mongodb-org/6.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-6.0.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y mongodb-org
```

| Add repo            | `echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-6.0.gpg] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu jammy/mongodb-org/6.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-6.0.list` |
| Install MongoDB     | `sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y mongodb-org`                                        |

**If wget also hangs, the issue is network/firewall and youâ€™ll need to ask your IT/network team to check access to `www.mongodb.org`.**
