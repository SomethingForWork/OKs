Reload Nginx
Apply to index.js
Run
nginx
5. Test Backend Directly
From your server, run:
Apply to index.js
Run
'
If this works (returns 200 or 401), your backend is fine.
If this fails, the problem is in your backend.
6. Test Through Nginx
From another machine:
Apply to index.js
Run
'
If this fails with 405, the problem is in Nginx config.
